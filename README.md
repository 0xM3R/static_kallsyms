# static_kallsyms
Rebuilds kallsyms statically from a kernel binary

This script was forked from laginimaineb/static_kallsyms with my own fixes and an adaptation for 64 bit kernels.

Tested on kernels of the following devices:
  Samsung Galaxy s5 (32 bit)
  LG Nexus 5x (64 bit)
  HTC One Plus X (32 bit)
  Huawei Nexus 6p (64 bit)
  Goldfish emulation kernel (64 bit)
